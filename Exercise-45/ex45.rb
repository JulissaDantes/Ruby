#EX.45 
#Here are your requirements:

# Make a different game from the one I made.
# Use more than one file, and use require to use them. Make sure you know what that is. DONE
# Use one class per room and give the classes names that fit their purpose (like GoldRoom, KoiPondRoom). DONE
# Your runner will need to know about these rooms, so make a class that runs them and knows about them. DONE
# There's plenty of ways to do this, but consider having each room return what room is next or setting a variable of what room is next.
